# Apply_Watermark_Image
Rough python script to apply a watermark image to another image.

Quick notes for this script.
-Does not resize images.
-Applies watermark in rough center of image. This can be easily changed.
-Images must be specified in the entry boxes based on their relative locations to the main.py file.

This can be changed up and improved quite a bit.
